## System Analysis and Design

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The driverPass project was about determining all the requirements that are necessary to launch a successful onilne driver's education and scheduling service by laying out various UML diagrams (i.e. activity, class, use case, and sequence) that are presentable to not only developers but to stakeholders and users. The client for this project is owner of DriverPass, Liam. Essentially, the owner expected a fully online schedule management, e-learning, and in-person management system that would cater to individuals who have access to a mobile, PC, or tablet devices.

### What did you do particularly well?

I particularly did well in clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements in an organized fashion according to the interview transcript with the DriverPass Project. I also believe I did well in constructing easy-to-understand UML diagrams for the final project.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the case 1 UML activity diagram and remove the parts where the secretary receives a phone call from the customer, or walk-in and retrieves user information. The reason for this, is because those instances are not incorporated in the software functionality. I would improve this by incorporating additional system logic that may be necessary for scheduling purposes. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's need by closely listening to their stories, listing and grouping them accordingly. I also attempt to understand the user's intent and desire for what they want the software to specifically accomplish. It's important consider the user's needs when designing because the end user is the last person to determine to use the product, or decide to use a product of a competitor. It's important to have an open ear to users as I have seen companies who have that lost a significant amount of users for that reason. 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

After taking this class, I approach designing software by listing out the requirements that the user and I want the software to be able to accomplish. I then manifest the various UML diagrams to present to stakeholders, users, and the development team to learn different perspective whether or not this is a product the end user wants to utilize. Once I have gained a good amount of reassurance on my product, is to finally implement the project and begin coding upon the design. After the initial implementation has been complete, the maintenance phase begins. This is when the team starts to accept user requests and implementing changes to the software after several bugs have been detected. Techniques and strategies that I would use in the future is take an agile and open communication approach so that a wider breathe of perspectives could be obtained so that the overall system design is polished and well informed.
