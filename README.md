## System Analysis and Design

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The driverPass project was about determining all the requirements that are necessary to launch a successful onilne driver's education and scheduling service by laying out various UML diagrams (i.e. activity, class, use case, and sequence) that is presentable to not only developers but to stakeholders and users. The client for this project is owner of DriverPass, Liam. Essentially, the owner expected a fully online schedule management, e-learning, and in-person management system that would cater to individuals who have access to a mobile, PC, or tablet devices.

### What did you do particularly well?

I particularly did well in clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements in an organized fashion according to the interview transcript with the DriverPass Project. I also believe I did well in constructing easy-to-understand UML diagrams for the final project.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the UML activity diagrams and remove the parts where the secretary receives a phone call from the customer, or walk-in and retrieves user information. The reason for this because those instances are not incorporated in the software functionality.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's need by closely listening to their stories and listing them out.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
